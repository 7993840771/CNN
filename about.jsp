<p><strong>Corresponding Disk</strong></p>
<img src="img/cor.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>
The very essence of technical courses is the overall development of the students. Their technical, communication and behavioral skills should improve during the course tenure, and they should be ready to adapt to the corporate environment by the end of the course.

We take every possible step to accomplish this very task of technical courses. The academic programs we chalk out for the students are created by the most experienced and efficient teaching staff, and they are aimed to develop the skills of our students in a progressive manner. Our technical students would not feel any burden whatsoever, and by the end of the programs, they become proficient in the respective aspects.

Regarding facilities, we take special care in this regard. We know that various amenities are required for the technical students to understand the subjects and prosper in the academics. Hence, we have stacked advanced infrastructure at our college, so that our students can use them seamlessly and concentrate on the academics.

Providing technical courses, like engineering, is a responsibility, and we excel gloriously in this regard. We provide high quality technical coaching, by which the students can earn impeccable proficiency, and they can use this expertise to serve various sectors.
</p>
<p><strong>Chairman's Disk</strong></p>
<img src="img/chair.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>
The greatness of American engineering education is not just due to the excellence and efficiency of the ivy league institutions like MIT, Harvard and Cal tech. Even the small and comparatively unknown universities such as Howard or Villa nova strive to impart quality education at par with any of the renowned institutions.

Likewise, VIJAYA hopes to compete respectably with the premier institutions in the state. With Sri P. Usha Kiran Kumar at the helm, we are certain that we would very soon accomplish that goal. Though a modest and humble person by nature, he is ambitious in his dreams for our institutions and always strives to do something beneficial to the institutions. A peep into the deeper recesses of his personality shows us a restless spirit housed in a tranquil mind.

Chairman’s Message :
We are heading towards a value based education and establishing our every institution as an ideal place to learn and know where one’s knowledge can be applied effectively.The success of VIJAYA lies in the collective effort of stakeholders,faculty and mentors backed by determination of our students and undeterred belief of their parents.
